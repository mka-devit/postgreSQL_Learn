I have been studying the fundamentals of SQL using PostgreSQL  

The database for running scripts is located in the "DB" folder.

### Download and Install PostgreSQL:  
1. Download PostgreSQL from the official website and install it on your computer.  
2. Launch **pgAdmin** to manage your database.  

### Load an SQL script using the "Query Tool":  
1. In the left menu, select the desired database.  
2. In the top menu, click **Tools → Query Tool**.  
3. Click **"Open File"** (folder icon) and select `*.sql`.  
4. Click **"Execute"** (▶ icon) to run the script.
