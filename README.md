I have been studying the fundamentals of SQL using PostgreSQL
The database for running scripts is located in the "DB" folder.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download and Install PostgreSQL

Download PostgreSQL from the official website and install it on your computer.
Launch pgAdmin to manage your database.
Load an SQL script using the "Query Tool"

In the left menu, select the desired database.
In the top menu, click Tools → Query Tool.
Click "Open File" (folder icon) and select 123.sql.
Click "Execute" (▶ icon) to run the script.
